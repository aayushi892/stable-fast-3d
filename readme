# Setting Up stable-fast-3d Offline

## Prerequisites
- **Python**: Ensure Python 3.8 or higher is installed. (Check PyTorch compatibility with Python versions.)
- **pip**: Version 20.0+.
- **GPU**: A compatible GPU with CUDA support (optional, but recommended for faster inference).

---

## Steps

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Stability-AI/stable-fast-3d.git
   cd stable-fast-3d
   ```

2. **Create a Virtual Environment**
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**
   - Install project dependencies from `requirements.txt`:
     ```bash
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```

4. **Handle PyTorch Installation**
   - PyTorch compatibility often depends on Python version and CUDA availability.
   - Visit the [PyTorch installation page](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/) for guidance.
   - Example:
     - For Python 3.8 and CUDA 11.7:
       ```bash
       pip install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu117
       ```
     - For CPU-only (no CUDA):
       ```bash
       pip install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cpu
       ```

5. **Download Pre-Trained Models**
   - If pre-trained models are needed:
     - Download them manually from the provided links or repository instructions.
     - Save them in a local directory, such as `models/`.
     - Update the configuration files (e.g., `config.yaml`) to use the local file paths.

6. **Set Up Offline Mode**
   - Modify settings to ensure the application runs without an internet connection.
   - Update configurations to point to local resources.

7. **Run the Project**
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

8. **Test Offline Functionality**
   - Disconnect from the internet.
   - Verify that the application operates fully offline.

## Challenges & Solutions

### **1. Python Version Compatibility**
- **Challenge**: PyTorch requires specific Python versions. For example, Python 3.12 is not yet fully supported in many PyTorch builds as of late 2024.
- **Solution**:
  - Ensure your Python version is compatible. PyTorch works well with Python 3.8â€“3.11.
  - Downgrade Python if necessary:
    ```bash
    conda install python=3.10  # If using Conda
    ```
    Or:
    ```bash
    pyenv install 3.10.12
    pyenv global 3.10.12
    ```

### **2. Dependency Installation**
- **Challenge**: Errors while installing PyTorch or its dependencies.
- **Solution**:
  - Upgrade pip, setuptools, and wheel:
    ```bash
    pip install --upgrade pip setuptools wheel
    ```
  - Use the specific PyTorch installation command from their [official guide](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/).

### **3. GPU and CUDA Setup**
- **Challenge**: CUDA version mismatch or lack of GPU support.
- **Solution**:
  - Check your CUDA version:
    ```bash
    nvcc --version
    ```
  - Match your PyTorch installation to your CUDA version (e.g., CUDA 11.7).

### **4. Missing Pre-Trained Models**
- **Challenge**: Pre-trained models are not downloaded automatically.
- **Solution**:
  - Manually download the models as instructed in the repository.
  - Place them in the `models/` directory and update file paths in the configuration.

## Example Command for Offline Mode
To run offline:
1. Disconnect from the internet.
2. Execute:
   ```bash
   python main.py --offline
   ```
